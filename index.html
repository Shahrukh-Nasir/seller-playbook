    <!-- Chosen Palette: Dark Harmony (Black, Teal, Amber) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tabbed single-page application with three main sections: a dynamic 'Playbook', a static 'Scaling Strategy', and a static 'Framework'. This provides a clear, progressive journey for the user from understanding the overall strategy to getting hands-on ideas and then learning how to optimize and plan their content mix. The playbook section retains its interactive sub-tabs and AI generator, while the new sections provide a clear, high-level overview of roles and expectations, as well as a strategic guide for content planning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The playbook's textual content is primarily lists of ideas. Goal: Inform/Inspire. Method: Interactive card-based lists. Interaction: Filtering by sub-category and one-click copy-to-clipboard. Justification: This provides fast, organized access and high utility for influencers needing to quickly grab and use an idea. The core interactive element is an AI Idea Generator. Goal: Empower/Generate. Method: A simple form calling the Gemini API. Interaction: User inputs product details, clicks to generate a unique idea. Justification: This transforms the static playbook into a dynamic, "smart" tool that provides endless, personalized inspiration, directly fulfilling the "AI-Enhanced" promise. No charts are needed. CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                                <li><strong>Only posting viral hook-style videos</strong><br>Viral reach is good, but it doesn‚Äôt always convert. If your feed is only hooks, people won‚Äôt build a relationship with the product or brand. You need loyalty content too - demos, usage tips, relatable lifestyle clips featuring the product.</li>
                                <li><strong>Not showing the product enough</strong><br>People can‚Äôt buy what they don‚Äôt see. Even ‚Äúboring‚Äù shots of the product in use keep it top-of-mind. Treat every post as a reminder it exists.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inconsistent posting</strong><br>Taking long breaks between posts kills momentum and the algorithm push. Even low-effort content is better than silence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ignoring ManyChat or DM automation</strong><br>This is one of the easiest ways to drive sales with zero extra effort. Set keyword triggers (like ‚Äúlink‚Äù or ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù) to automatically send shop links, offers, or VIP early access invites.</li>
                                <li><strong>Not leveraging storytelling</strong><br>Facts tell, stories sell. Talk about why the product exists, how it helped you personally, or share a customer‚Äôs transformation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Not engaging with the audience</strong><br>Posting and disappearing doesn‚Äôt work. Reply to comments, thank buyers, ask questions, and keep conversations going.</li>
